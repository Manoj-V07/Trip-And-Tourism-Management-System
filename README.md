# Trip-And-Tourism-Management-System
ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

The Travel and Tourism Management System is a Java-based application designed to simplify and automate the process of managing travel services for both customers and administrators (travel agencies).

The system allows customers to search for travel packages by destination, price, or duration, view details, make bookings, and receive instant confirmations. It also supports booking cancellations and maintains customer records for easy access.

For administrators, the system provides features to add, update, and delete travel packages, manage customer details, and generate reports such as booking statistics and revenue summaries. This ensures efficient management of travel services and reduces manual errors.

The project is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and composition.

Encapsulation secures sensitive data like user details.

Inheritance is applied where Customer and Admin extend from User.

Polymorphism is used in methods like login() and searchPackages().

Abstraction helps define common behaviors in the User class.

Composition ensures that a Booking cannot exist without a Package.
